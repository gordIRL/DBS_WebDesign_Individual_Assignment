# DBS_WebDesign_Individual_Assignment

Assignment for my Web Design Module, Level 8, Higher Diploma in Computer Science (Software Development) 
in DBS, Dublin Business School.

Developed using only HTML, CSS and Javascript - no other technologies above were permitted for this assignment 
and all GUI elements and images were self sourced.

(There is a form on the contact page, with some light Javascript validation, 
but it is not wired up to anything, e.g. a database, out of scope for this assignment).
