		<h3>Delicious Breakfasts:</h3>
			<p role="contentinfo">
				Winner of ‘Best Breakfast Award’
				Breakfast, in the bright leafy Conservatory, is the only meal served at Ellens's B&amp;B.
				Everything is freshly prepared and cooked to order. We pride ourselves on our breakfast with a varied choice of dishes including seafood, devilled kidneys, the ‘full Irish’, locally-smoked salmon, organic porridge, free-range eggs and farm cheeses. Our famous brown bread and fruit brack are both baked daily in the AGA.
				We only serve freshly-squeezed orange juice together with fresh fruits, organic muesli and yogurt. All special dietary requirements can be looked after.

				My husband and I had the pleasure to stay here for two nights. There's no words to describe how excellent everything was!! 
				The house is beautifully located right on the water&#39;s edge. I have to say it is the cleanest B&amp;B we've ever been to. 
				Ellen is a fantastic host who made us feel very welcome. Her cooking skills are so impressive, very,very high standard! 
				I'm so glad we have found this gem! Can't wait to come back there!! (Alison W.)
